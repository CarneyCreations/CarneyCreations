# Hey, I'm Joshua!

## < Bio >
My main passions in life have all been based around design and technology. Last year, whilst re-evaluating my future, I realised that programming encapsulated all of these passions.

Since discovering coding and I began learning the basics and am now only several weeks away from completing a Software Engineering bootcamp. The tech industry is where I want to be and I believe that by being a developer, I can build a career that utilises my strengths and enables me to reach my full potential within the role and progress.

## < Current Project >
Currently I am working on a [Capital Gains Tax calculator](https://github.com/CarneyCreations/capital_gains_calculator/blob/main/capital_gains_calculator.py) which complies with the HMRC guidelines. This is my first program with real-world application so I am very excited by this. The reward for me is that if I complete the program to a working standard within a week I can save myself Â£219 by not having to use a pre-existing calculator.

## < Employers >
I am looking to switch careers into development so if you are an employer who is hiring, please contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuapjcarney/) and I would be happy to talk. I may not have years of experience yet but I make up for it in my dedication, work ethic and willingness to learn.

## < Contact Details >
For anyone who isn't an employer who just wants to collaborate or chat, feel free to contact me [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuapjcarney/).
